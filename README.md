# Udacity Books API

The application fetches data from the Udacity API in order to search for new users and questions, which means internet access is required for all functionality to work correctly. This backend server is required for the project to run correctly, but no additional installation or changes need to be made to the code. The file DATA contains all methods that work with this API, as well as some mocked data.
